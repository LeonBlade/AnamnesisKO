# Anamnesis (Korean)

# NOTE: This is the Korean version of Anamnesis, it's still in Beta

Anamnesis is a standalone tool that is used to modify certain clientside-only values and allow the user a greater degree of flexibility for making creative and interesting screenshots. In short, this tool allows its users to temporarily change their race, gender, looks, equipment, etc. in game without actually making any changes visible to other players. This tool also allows users to create their own poses. 

Anamnesis is the successor to [Concept Matrix (CMTool)](https://github.com/imchillin/CMTool).

As of April 16th 2021, this project remains a work in progress and is not currently in a state to replace CMTool. Please do not download the code expecting it to work like CMTool.

We actively encourage people to contribute to the project with their forks to improve the tool overall. With this said, we are **not** supporting builds done via forks and, if you've received a release of the tool from any repo that isn't [imchillin/Anamnesis](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis), you are encouraged to bring the issue up with the person who packaged the build, as it will inevitably contain code we're unfamiliar with.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 5.0 Desktop Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.7-windows-x64-installer) installed on your computer. Anamnesis will only work with 64-bit versions of Windows. Support will not be added for x86/32-bit versions of Windows.
- Windows 10 (there are no plans to add support for older versions of Windows that [Microsoft is not in turn supporting](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/windows-7-end-of-life-support-information), or other operating systems).

### Installation

Download the latest build from [the releases page](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis/releases/latest), then simply extract it to your location of choice, log in to the game, and run the tool.
